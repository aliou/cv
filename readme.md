Working in the Backend team, my responsibilities included creating a Docker-ized version of the platform to be used locally, on-boarding new members of the team, implementing and keeping up to date the different APIs and services of the platform.

More precisely, I worked on:
- Creating a public Gem (Ruby Library) consuming one of our service's API, both for public and private applications.
- Docker-ized the different services of our platform allowing us to use them locally during development, with the help of our SRE.
- Used those to create a new on boarding process that was updated with the arrival of new team members.
- Helped the conception of a customer segmentation feature using data sent by customers from their CMS or through our APIs.
- Worked on a real time data aggregation pipeline using AWS Lambda and AWS Kinesis Firehose.
- Helped the early conception of a real time data pipeline using Apache Kafka and written in Elixir.
